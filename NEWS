Version 0.7.0
=============

This release breaks badly with all previous version because we renamed several
filters and properties to clean up inconsistencies.

Major changes include:

- Integration tests have been moved to core
- writer: allow 8 and 16 bit uint output
- reader: support Multi EDF files
- reader: add y-step parameter
- reader: from:to:step selection of files
- flatfieldcorrection: add "dark-scale" property

New filters:

- Import uPIV related filters by Alexandre Lewkowicz

- Add slice mapper to arrange input as a single grid
- Add inplace flatten task for sum, min and max
- Add interpolation task to interpolate between two streams
- Add flatten task based on median sort
- Add stack task to create a volume from 2D series
- Add transpose task to rotate data
- Add measure task to measure image metrics
- Add PolarCoordinates task
- Integration of UfoIR algebraic reconstruction tasks

Version 0.6.0
=============

Changes
-------

- Added angle offset parameter to backproject filter.
- Fix backprojection for NaN in input
- Fix LUT computation resulting in wrong reconstructions.
- Install kernel files into ${datadir}/ufo as required by ufo-core 0.6.

New filters
-----------

- "generate": takes width, height and depth parameters as well as a number that
  is produces with the specified dimensions.
- "downsample": reduce the size of an image by an integer
